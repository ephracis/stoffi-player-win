# Stoffi Player on Windows
This is the windows client of the Stoffi player.

This project depends on [Stoffi Core](https://github.com/simplare/stoffi-player-core), so you need to run
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    
And since [Stoffi Core](https://github.com/simplare/stoffi-player-core) has submodules on its own, you need to run the same commands inside the `Core` folder.
